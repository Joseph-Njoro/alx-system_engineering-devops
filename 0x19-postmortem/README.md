# Incident Report: Database Outage at Faras

## Issue Summary

- **Duration**: The outage began on August 15, 2024, at 09:00 AM (EAT) and was resolved by August 15, 2024, at 01:30 PM (EAT).
- **Impact**: Faras experienced a significant disruption to its primary customer-facing application. Users faced frequent error messages and slow performance, which hindered their ability to access their accounts and perform transactions. This disruption affected approximately 80% of users, including internal staff and external customers.
- **Root Cause**: The primary cause of the outage was a memory leak within the database management system. This leak led to resource exhaustion, causing the database server to crash and subsequently affecting the availability and performance of the application.

## Timeline

- **09:00 AM (EAT)**: Automated monitoring systems detected an anomaly with increased error rates and high latency, triggering alerts.
- **09:05 AM (EAT)**: Initial customer complaints started to pour in through the support channels, confirming the monitoring alerts.
- **09:15 AM (EAT)**: The operations team began investigating the issue. Initial checks included server logs and resource utilization metrics. However, the investigation mistakenly focused on potential network issues.
- **10:00 AM (EAT)**: A significant amount of time was spent investigating network configurations and external connections, which proved to be misleading as the root cause was unrelated to these areas.
- **11:00 AM (EAT)**: The database administrator reviewed the issue more deeply and discovered that the problem stemmed from memory exhaustion, rather than network-related causes.
- **12:00 PM (EAT)**: The incident was escalated to the development team for a more focused resolution. The development team was tasked with applying a patch and optimizing database queries to alleviate the issue.
- **01:00 PM (EAT)**: The database server was reconfigured with increased memory resources, and a patch addressing the memory leak was successfully applied. Additionally, database queries were optimized to reduce the load on the server.
- **01:30 PM (EAT)**: Normal operations were restored. The system was closely monitored to ensure stability and prevent recurrence of similar issues.

## Root Cause and Resolution

- **Root Cause**: The outage was caused by a memory leak within the database management system. This defect led to excessive memory usage, which eventually exhausted server resources and caused the server to crash, leading to application downtime.
- **Resolution**: To resolve the issue, additional memory was allocated to the database server to handle increased load. A critical patch was applied to the database management system to fix the memory leak. Furthermore, the development team optimized database queries to improve performance and reduce resource consumption.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures

- **Improvements Needed**:
  - **Enhanced Monitoring**: Implement advanced monitoring tools to track database performance metrics and resource usage more effectively.
  - **Query Optimization**: Improve database query optimization and indexing strategies to reduce server load and enhance performance.
  - **Alerting Mechanisms**: Establish automated alerts for memory usage thresholds and performance anomalies to enable quicker detection of similar issues.

- **Specific Tasks**:
  1. Apply a patch to address and fix the memory leak in the database management system.
  2. Increase the memory allocation for the database server to better handle high loads.
  3. Optimize existing database queries and add necessary indexes to improve efficiency.
  4. Implement detailed monitoring and alerting systems focused on memory usage and database performance.
  5. Conduct a comprehensive review of current database management practices and resource allocation strategies to prevent future incidents.

## Teams Involved

- **Operations Team**: Led the initial investigation and managed server resources during the outage.
- **Database Administrator**: Identified the root cause and applied the necessary patch to resolve the memory leak issue.
- **Development Team**: Assisted with query optimization and implemented fixes to the database system.
- **Customer Support Team**: Handled user complaints and provided timely updates throughout the incident.
